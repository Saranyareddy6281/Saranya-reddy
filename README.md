### Objective 

The objective of this project is to predict housing prices accurately based on various features such as square footage, number of bedrooms, and location, in order to provide insights for real estate pricing strategies and support informed decision-making.

### Key Activities

-**Data collection and preparation:**
 Acquire the Dataset: Obtain a dataset containing relevant features and 
 target variables, such as the Boston Housing dataset or a similar dataset.

 -**Performance Metrics:**
 Calculate MAE, MSE, RMSE, R²: Measure model accuracy using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R² Score.

### Technologies Used
  -**Python:** Widely used for data manipulation, analysis, and modeling due 
    to its rich ecosystem of libraries..
  - **Pandas:** Used for Data manipulation and cleaning.
  - **Numpy:** For numerical operations and handling arrays.
  - **Matplotlib:** For creating static, animated, and interactive 
     visualizations.
 - **Seaborn :** For statistical data visualization and enhanced plotting capabilities.
